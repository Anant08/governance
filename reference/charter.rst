=======================================
 OpenStack Technical Committee Charter
=======================================

Mission
=======

The Technical Committee ("TC") is tasked with providing the technical
leadership for OpenStack as a whole (all official projects, as defined below).
It enforces OpenStack ideals (Openness, Transparency, Commonality, Integration,
Quality...), decides on issues affecting multiple projects, forms an ultimate
appeals board for technical decisions, and generally has technical oversight
over all of OpenStack.

OpenStack Project Teams
=======================

OpenStack "Project Teams" are groups of people dedicated to the completion of
the OpenStack project mission, which is ''to produce a ubiquitous Open Source
Cloud Computing platform that is easy to use, simple to implement,
interoperable between deployments, works well at all scales, and meets
the needs of users and operators of both public and private clouds.''
Project Teams may create any code repository and produce any deliverable they
deem necessary to achieve their goals.

The work of project teams is performed under the oversight of the TC.
Contributing to one of their associated code repositories grants you ATC status
(see below). The TC has ultimate authority over which project teams are
designated as official OpenStack projects. The projects are listed in
:ref:`projects`.

Project Team Leads
==================

Project Team Leads ("PTLs") manage day-to-day operations, drive the team goals
and resolve technical disputes within their team. Each team
should be self-managing by the contributors, and all disputes should be
resolved through active debate and discussion by the community itself. However
if a given debate cannot be clearly resolved, the PTL can decide the outcome.
Although the TC is generally not involved in team-internal decisions, it
still has oversight over team decisions, especially when they
affect other teams or go contrary to general OpenStack goals.

TC Members
==========

The TC is composed of 13 directly-elected members. It is partially renewed
using elections every 6 months. All TC members must be OpenStack Foundation
individual members. You can cumulate any other role, including Foundation
Director, with a TC seat.

TC Chair
========

After each election, the TC proposes one of its members to act as the TC chair.
In case of multiple candidates, it may use a single-winner election method to
decide the result (see below). The Board of Directors has the authority to
approve the TC chair and shall approve the proposition, unless otherwise
justified by its bylaws. The TC chair is responsible for making sure meetings
are held according to the rules described below, and for communicating the
decisions taken during those meetings to the Board of Directors and the
OpenStack community at large. It may be revoked under the conditions described
in the Foundation bylaws.

Meeting
=======

TC meetings happen publicly, weekly on IRC. The meeting time should be decided
among TC members after each election. If there isn't consensus on a meeting
time, the option of rotating the time weekly should be explored. The TC
maintains an open agenda on the wiki. A TC meeting is automatically called if
anything is posted to that wiki by one of its members at least one day before
the meeting time. For a meeting to be actually held, at least half of the
members need to be present (rounded up: in a 13-member committee that means a
minimum of 7 people present). Non-members affected by a given discussion are
strongly encouraged to participate in the meeting and voice their opinion,
though only TC members can ultimately cast a vote.

Motions
=======

Before being put to a vote, motions presented before the TC should be discussed
publicly on the development mailing-list for a minimum of 4 business days to
give a chance to the wider community to express their opinion. TC members can
vote positively, negatively, or abstain. Decisions need more positive votes
than negative votes (ties mean the motion is rejected), and a minimum of
positive votes of at least one third of the total number of TC members (rounded
up: in a 13-member committee that means a minimum of 5 approvers).

Proxying
========

When a TC member is unable to make a meeting, they are encouraged to name a proxy
that will represent their opinion and vote on their behalf during the meeting.
Only members really present at the meeting (directly or proxied) can vote.
A TC member may proxy another member, but nobody should ever represent more
than two votes.

Election for PTL seats
======================

PTL seats are completely renewed every development cycle. A separate election
is run for each project team. These elections are collectively held no later
than 3 weeks prior to each cycle final release date (on or before 'R-3' week)
and should be held open for no less than four business days.

Voters for PTL seats ("APC")
============================

Voters for a given project's PTL election are the Active Project Contributors
("APC"), which are a subset of the Foundation Individual Members. Individual
Members who committed a change to a repository of a project over the last two
6-month release cycles are considered APC for that project team.

Candidates for PTL seats
========================

Any APC can propose their candidacy for the corresponding project PTL election.
Sitting PTLs are eligible to run for re-election each cycle, provided they
continue to meet the criteria.

Election for TC seats
=====================

The 13 TC seats are partially renewed every 6 months using staggered elections:
6 seats are renewed every (Northern hemisphere) Fall, and 7 seats are renewed
every Spring. Seats are valid for one-year terms. For this election we'll use a
multiple-winner election system (see below). The election is held no later than
3 weeks prior to each OpenStack Summit (on or before 'S-3' week), with
elections held open for no less than four business days.

If a seat on the TC is vacated before the end of the term for which
the member was elected, the TC will select a replacement to serve out
the remainder of the term. The mechanism for selecting the replacement
depends on when the seat is vacated relative to the beginning of the
candidacy period for the next scheduled TC election. Selected
candidates must meet all other constraints for membership in the TC.

* If the vacancy opens less than four weeks before the candidacy
  period for the next scheduled TC election begins, and the seat
  vacated would have been contested in the upcoming election anyway,
  then the seat will remain open until the election and filled by the
  normal election process.
* If the vacancy opens less than four weeks before the candidacy
  period for the next scheduled TC election begins and the seat would
  not have been contested in the upcoming election, the candidates who
  do not win seats in the election will be consulted in the order they
  appear in the results until a candidate who is capable of serving
  agrees to serve out the partial term.
* If the vacancy opens with more than four weeks until the candidacy
  period for the next scheduled TC election begins, regardless of
  whether the vacated seat would have been contested in the next
  election, the candidates who did not win seats in the most recent
  previous TC election will be consulted in the order they appear in
  the results until a candidate who is capable of serving agrees to
  serve out the partial term.

Voters for TC seats ("ATC")
===========================

The TC seats are elected by the Active Technical Contributors ("ATC"), which
are a subset of the Foundation Individual Members. Individual Members who
committed a change to a repository under any of the official OpenStack
Project Teams (as defined in :ref:`projects`) over the last two
6-month release cycles are automatically considered ATC. Specific contributors
who did not have a change recently accepted in one of the OpenStack projects
but nevertheless feel their contribution to the OpenStack project is technical
in nature (bug triaging not tracked in Gerrit, for example) can exceptionally
apply for ATC either by sending an email to the TC chair or by being nominated
by an existing ATC via email to the TC chair. Final approval on the exception is
decided by the TC itself, and is valid one year (two elections).

Candidates for TC seats
=======================

Any Foundation individual member can propose their candidacy for an
available, directly-elected TC seat. `Appendix 4 of the Foundation
Bylaws
<http://www.openstack.org/legal/technical-committee-member-policy/>`__
describe eligibility requirements and membership constraints for the
Technical Committee.

Initial committee
=================

The current TC will serve as TC until the elections in Fall 2013. At that
point, the two TC members who still had 6 months to serve get a 6-month seat,
and an election is run to determine the 11 other members. Candidates ranking
1st to 6th would get one-year seats, and candidates ranking 7th to 11th would
get 6-month seats. Spring 2014 elections should see the normal renewal of 7
seats.

Election systems
================

For single-winner elections, a Condorcet system shall be used.

For multiple-winner elections, a Condorcet or a STV system should be used.

Amendment
=========

Amendments to this Technical Committee charter shall be proposed in a special
motion, which needs to be approved by the affirmative vote of at least
two-thirds of the total number of TC members (rounded up: in a 13-member
committee that means a minimum of 9 approvers).
